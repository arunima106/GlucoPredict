### Project Description
The HbA1c Calculator is a web-based application that allows users to enter their daily blood sugar readings over a period of 90 days. After completing the data entry, the app calculates the estimated HbA1c (%), a key indicator for long-term blood sugar control.

### The Problem statement
Many people, especially those with diabetes or prediabetes, need to monitor their long-term blood sugar control. The HbA1c test is a crucial metric that reflects the average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months, but:

Lack of Daily Tracking – Many individuals track daily blood sugar but don’t have a way to estimate their HbA1c without a lab test.
Limited Access to Lab Tests – Lab-based HbA1c tests can be expensive or inconvenient, especially for those in remote areas.
No Immediate Feedback – Patients need a quick way to estimate how their daily readings affect their long-term health.
Manual Calculations Are Difficult – The formula to estimate HbA1c is not widely known, making self-assessment hard.

### The Solution
✅ Instant HbA1c Estimation – Users can track and calculate their estimated HbA1c from daily readings without waiting for a lab test.
✅ Encourages Consistent Monitoring – The progress bar and tracking system motivate users to consistently log their blood sugar levels.
✅ Easy-to-Use & Accessible – The tool is free, online, and simple, making it useful for anyone managing diabetes.
✅ Better Health Awareness – Helps users understand how their blood sugar trends impact their long-term health, leading to better decision-making about diet, exercise, and medication.
